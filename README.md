# Scheduler
This is the link to the deployed site: https://aubreyhatake.github.io/Scheduler/
In this site the user is able to type in their schedule and their entered data will be saved into the local storage. 
This makes it so when the page refreshes no data is lost ! If you right click on the page, go to inspect, then go to applications. Once you see the local storage drop down and click on it you will be able to view your entered data in the local storage on your system!!
